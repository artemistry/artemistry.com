It's important to see beauty, to show your brain as many examples of beauty as possible, so it can mix everything it has seen together and create a new beauty. Just like nature does with mixing genes, a human mixes his visual discoveries and shapes his taste. Expose yourself to beauty. Develop your taste. And then leave the world more beautiful than you found it. 🤘🏻"

Before you get a chance to tell me anything - you need to get my attention. What gets people’s attention universally? Confidence. It’s seductive. It’s comforting. It’s optimistic. So if you want attention, if you want to stand out, if you want to be heard - express your confidence. Make moves that will make people around you wonder - who is she and why she has confidence to do what she does. Where did she get that confidence from and how can I get it too. And then inspire others to get theirs by telling your story. By lifting others up, by supporting them and giving advice when they ask for it. Get your confidence up and then help others to get theirs. All starts with attention."

      "Real talk here. The fear of rejection is damaging lives of so many talented and hardworking people. It’s stopping them or slowing them down from getting what would otherwise make them truly happy. Breaks my heart to see my friends suffering from it. What’s the cure? Getting comfortable with rejection. Going to the \"rejection gym\" and doing those \"rejection push ups\". What do I mean? Do all the right actions with the best intentions in mind and expect - a rejection. I know - it’s not fun, it’s not comfortable, it’s painful, but that’s how you grow your \"rejection muscle\". Doesn’t matter what you do in life - find a way to exercise your \"rejection muscle\". I’ll give you my example. I have a photography project - Boobs of London - that’s my \"rejection gym\". Good luck with asking women if they’re excited to get their boobs photographed and their intimate stories published. It’s a rejection, after rejection, after rejection. But that’s the point. The muscle is growing and with it - your chance of creating something remarkable. And quite frankly - just living a more fulfilling and happier life! So please, take some time off this weekend and brainstorm ideas of how you’re going to exercise your \"rejection muscle\". If you’re out of ideas - get in touch - I’ll help you out. With this post I am opening a \"rejection gym\". Everyone’s welcome. The membership is free."
